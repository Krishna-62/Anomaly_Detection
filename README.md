# Anomaly_Detection
Predictive analytics with time series forecasting and anomaly detection in Python involves using models like ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet to forecast future trends and detect unusual patterns. Libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and statsmodels make implementation efficient.

Step-by-Step Process Followed to Develop the Project
Data Collection: Gathered time series data from reliable sources (e.g., CSV, APIs, databases).

Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized data, and ensured a consistent timestamp format.

Visualization: Plotted data trends to understand seasonality, trends, and potential anomalies.

Model Selection: Chose forecasting models like ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet based on data characteristics.

Model Training & Validation: Split data, trained models, validated using metrics like RMSE/MAE.

Anomaly Detection: Applied statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR) and machine learning models (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to identify anomalies.

Evaluation: Assessed accuracy and precision of anomaly detection.

Deployment: Created a basic dashboard or script for real-time forecasting and anomaly flagging.
